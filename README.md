# NVIDIA-Python-Physics-Test
Code and testing suite for physics

## Work and Progress 

### QuTiP vs NVIDIA CUDA-Q
Testing physics simulation using QuTip vs NVIDIA's CUDA-Q suite (CPU vs GPU programming). Will test speed vs. cluster performance.

### AI Assisted GUI Generation
AI to generate GUIs for controlling and communicating with external devices.
